Installation
------------
Fork the repo and git clone it in your home directory
Then add

    source $HOME/oh-my-git/prompt.sh

to the bash startup file (~/.profile on Mac, .bash_profile or .bashrc on Linux)

Known bugs and limitations
--------------------------
* It works weird on brand new repositories, before the first commit
* It has been tested on Mac only
* You need an unicode font (like Menlo or Monaco on Mac OS X)

zsh version
-----------
Coming soon. I'm working on the integration with zsh + oh-my-zsh + antigen
Wanna help? Great! Fork it! It will be really appreciated!
